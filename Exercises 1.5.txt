EXERCISE 1.5: 
SIZES OF IMAGES
In the Exercise 1.3 we used devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu.

Here is the same application but instead of Ubuntu is using Alpine Linux: devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine.

Pull both images and compare the image sizes. 

>>> answers
> docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
> docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
> image size of ubuntu is 83Mb where as equivalent of alpine only 15.7Mb. 

Go inside the alpine container and make sure the secret message functionality is the same. Alpine version doesn't have bash but it has sh.

>>> answers
> docker run -d --rm -it --name secret devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
> docker exec -it secret sh
> tail -f ./text.log
> Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
