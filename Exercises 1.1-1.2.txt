EXERCISE 1.1: GETTING STARTED

Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.
Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.

> docker container run -d nginx
> docker container run -d nginx
> docker container run -d nginx

Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.
> docker container stop bb
> docker container stop 70

Submit the output for docker ps -a which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.

> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

701ce72b2b79   nginx          "/docker-entrypoint.…"   47 seconds ago   Exited (0) 3 seconds ago              dazzling_germain

---------------------
EXERCISE 1.2: CLEANUP

We have containers and an image that are no longer in use and are taking up space. Running docker ps -as and docker images will confirm this.
> docker ps -as
> docker images -a
...stuff

Clean the Docker daemon by removing all images and containers.
> docker container stop bb
> docker container stop 701
> docker container stop 98
> docker container stop 6b

> docker container rm 70
> docker container rm bb
> docker container rm 98
> docker container rm 6b

> docker image rm 9f
> docker image rm 10
> docker image rm 5e
> docker image rm 44


Submit the output for docker ps -a and docker images

> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
