EXERCISE 1.1: GETTING STARTED

Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.
Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.

> docker container run -d nginx
> docker container run -d nginx
> docker container run -d nginx

Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.

$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

Submit the output for docker ps -a which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.
