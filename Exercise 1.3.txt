EXERCISE 1.3: SECRET MESSAGE

Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu will start a container 
that outputs logs into a file. 

Go inside the container and use tail -f ./text.log to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".
