I created a simple Next.js. It is all about entering a name 
and clicking either submit or reset buttons. 

docker build -t echoer . && docker run -p 3000:3000 echoer

and after having tested that the app works ok in my local browser, 
deployed the app onto Render.com as web service. 

It is available at here:
