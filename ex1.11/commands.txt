EXERCISE 1.11: SPRING
Create a Dockerfile for an old Java Spring project 
that can be found from the course repository.

The setup should be straightforward with the README instructions. 
Tips to get you started:

Use openjdk image FROM openjdk:_tag_ to get Java instead of installing it manually. 
Pick the tag by using the README and Docker Hub page.

You've completed the exercise when you see a 'Success' message in your browser.

Submit the Dockerfile you used to run the container.

>> docker build . -t spring-example 
>> docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-example
